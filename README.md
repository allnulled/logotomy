# 4. API

Yet to be done.

# 5. Language Reference

The language is very simple:

You can write all in natural language, but
for meaningful analysis, you should indent
all the grammar by yourself, at least from
your own perspective, no need to provide a
strictly correct grammar tree.

# 6. Goals

Provide meaningful relations analysis
between linguistical onthologies
from a programmatic and intuitive perspectives
in order to empower language consciousness
for the machine and the human.

And from there, we will see.
